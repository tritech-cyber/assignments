Add the following to the end of ~/.bash_aliases
<bold>alias python=python3</bold>
This sets your personal bash settings to python3.
If you use root or another user it should default to 2.7 
if .bashrc or .bash_aliases has not have this line:
alias python=python3
<hr />
All code needs to be upload to your github.com/user/python/ repo

[ ] https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python (100%) Screenshot you progress. Put this graphic in your python repo.
[ ] count.py - we did this the first week
[ ] input3.py  (Input A,B, and C for "y = Ax^2 + Bx +C" and calculate the output of y.)
[ ] input3_while.py (Input A,B, and C.  Use a while True: loop to output x and y for a quadratic equation.
[ ] Write a program this displays a string, float and integer on one line. 
	The float and integer must be a calculations.
	No def functions():
	name file print_sfi.py
[ ] Write a program that has four functions:
	def intcalc():  
	def floatcalc():
	def stringcat():
	def main():
	main()
	name file print_sfi_functions.py
[ ]Write a program that displays the ASCII table.  Name file asc.py.  Use a <bold> for loop</bold>
	Use the following:	
		print("[",i,"=",c,"]",end="")
		if (i % 10 == 0):
			print("\n")
[ ]Write a program with a function def randomint(): that returns a random integers. Include a def main():
	random_int.py
[ ]Write a program with a function def randomchar(): that returns a random charater. Include a def main():
	random_char_all.py (Include the following characters:
			abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 01234567890)
			`[]\;’,./~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:”<>?
			$ grep -o 'some@text' filewithallthecharactersinit.txt | wc -l
[ ]Learn how to print colors using the python ternminal.  Refer to https://github.com/tritech-cyber/python
	color_text_design.py

[ ] find_factors.py 
[ ] multiplication.py 
[ ] convert_kmmi.py
[ ] quadratic.py 

DO MORE THAN THE MINIMUM!

Group Project
[ ] Python Graphic Project - Start 171006
	Divide into groups of 3 or 4.  Each person write some python code using the graphics.py modules that creates
	a design.  Put all the graphics into on e file.  Present the project to the group.  
	Each person explains their code.
	Python Graphic Project (30 points.) 
Presentation Rubric: 
- All code works.
- Every student talks about their design.
- Group explains how they put things together.
