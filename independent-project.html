<div class="blk">CYBER SECURITY - YEAR 1 & 2 INDEPENENT PROJECT</div>
Employers in Informaton Technology fields like future employees
to have projects they are working on.
So I (CWC) am asking people in CS to come up with an idea for a project to work
on until the end of the year during class and at home.
This project needs to be releated to Computer Science or Cyber Security
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
This must be more than an idea you pulled out of the air.
This needs to be something concrete you are working on.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
The progress of this project needs to be posted on your github site.
username.github.io
There must be a direct link on the index.html page of your usename.github.io account
to this project.
